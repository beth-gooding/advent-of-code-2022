# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions

This project contains my solutions to the 2022 Advent of Code puzzles. You can find the puzzles [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022) and more information about Advent of Code [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about).

To run this project, you will first need to install Node (I am using version 18.9.1). Then on your local machine, you can run all of the solutions at once using the command:

``` bash
node index.js
```

This will display the answers in the console.
